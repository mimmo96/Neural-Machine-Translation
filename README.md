# Neural Machine Translation

This is a project for the course of Human Language Technologies

## Dataset folder

Contains a series of sentences used for thraining, validation and test phases

## Project

In this project, the idea is to start with an NMT model with Seq2Seq architecture and a specific dataset to be analyzed, separated, and used for machine learning of our architecture.
I had used two different type of Model, the first one called ''Seq2Seq_withoutAttention.ipynb'' that is Seq2Seq model without Attention Mechanism and with the use of LSMT.
The other one is a Seq2Seq model with Attention Mechanism who help in the phases of learning of long sequence and you can find in a file called ''Seq2Seq.ipynb''.

All of code was written with Jupter Notebook
